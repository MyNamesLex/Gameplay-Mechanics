# Sword Combat

This is a tech demo for sword combat.

There is no animations for swinging or blocking, there is states to show what the player is doing in the top left of the screen and the enemy states in the bottom left.

The player can go over to the right and change what the enemy state is to blocking, stunned or swinging sword by walking onto the corresponding button to see what occurs when the player does something. This can include swinging the sword, blocking or doing nothing.

There is also the ability to restart the scene by going to the left and walking onto the restart scene button.

## Controls

Left Click - Swing Sword

Right Click - Block

## Footnote
Art and Level Design is just for testing purposes, my aim with this was to make a Sword Combat Tech Demo, not an actual game
