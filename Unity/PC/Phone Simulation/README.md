# Phone Simulation

This is a bare bones simulation of a phone I decided to do that could be a gameplay mechanic in a game.

## Controls

Click And Swipe Right On Phone (While On Home Screen) - Forward A Page

Click And Swipe Left On Phone (While On Home Screen) - Back A Page

Click On App - Enters App

Home Button (Bottom Of Phone) - Exit An App

Send Message Button - Sends Message To Phone With The Text Entered From The Sender Input Field And Message Input Field

## Footnote
Art and Level Design is just for testing purposes, my aim with this was to make a simulation of a phone, not an actual game
